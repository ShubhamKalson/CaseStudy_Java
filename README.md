# CaseStudy_Java

I've established two classes within seperate packages. One package, "company.casestudy" houses the "CaseStudy_Employee" class, while the "company.case" package contains the "CaseStudy_EmployeeTest" class. The "company.case" package has been imported into the "company.casestudy" package.
